## Session Log

### Session Log 2026-02-01 (Afternoon)

**Timestamp**: Session start ~afternoon

**Activities**:
1. **Critical Bug Discovery: Duplicate Path Segments in Cloudinary URLs** (~30 minutes)
   - **Problem Identified**: All 634 Cloudinary URLs contained duplicated path segments
   - **Example**: `.../myblog/travelogue/camino/ch1/myblog/travelogue/camino/ch1/IMG_xxx.jpg`
   - **Should be**: `.../myblog/travelogue/camino/ch1/IMG_xxx.jpg`
   - **Impact**: All media links returned 404 errors, website displayed no images/videos
   - **Root Cause**: `upload_to_cloudinary.py` was setting both `folder` parameter and `public_id` with full path, causing Cloudinary to duplicate the path

2. **URL Fix Process** (~20 minutes)
   - Created temporary fix scripts:
     - `fix_duplicate_paths.py`: Remove duplicate `/myblog/.../myblog/...` patterns
     - `fix_missing_slashes.py`: Fix missing slashes (e.g., `ch1IMG_xxx.jpg` → `ch1/IMG_xxx.jpg`)
   - Fixed 634 URLs in 6 markdown files
   - Fixed 660 URLs in `cloudinary_mapping.json`
   - Total: 1,294 URLs fixed

3. **Code Refactoring: Improve upload_to_cloudinary.py** (~30 minutes)
   - **Added `normalize_url()` function**:
     - Removes duplicate path segments automatically
     - Fixes missing slashes before filenames
     - Ensures consistent URL format
   - **Improved `public_id` construction**:
     - Normalized path separators (Windows `\` → `/`)
     - Removed `folder` parameter to prevent duplication
     - Removed `use_filename=True` to avoid conflicts with custom `public_id`
   - **Added URL normalization in `save_mapping()`**:
     - Normalizes all URLs before saving to mapping file
     - Ensures future uploads generate correct URLs
   - **Deleted temporary fix scripts**:
     - Removed `fix_duplicate_paths.py`
     - Removed `fix_missing_slashes.py`
   - **Result**: Future uploads will automatically generate correct URLs without needing fix scripts

4. **Git Push Issues** (~10 minutes)
   - Attempted to push 4-5 commits to remote
   - **Issue**: PowerShell commands showing no output (possible terminal/encoding issue)
   - Commands executed but unable to verify completion status
   - **Status**: Unclear if push completed successfully
   - **Pending**: Manual verification needed

5. **Website Testing** (~5 minutes)
   - Attempted to start Hugo server for local testing
   - **Issue**: Hugo server connection refused (may need manual start)
   - **URL Verification**: Confirmed markdown files contain correct URL format
   - **Status**: URLs verified in source files, but website not tested yet

**Outcome - Current State**:
- ✅ **URL Format Fixed**: All 634 markdown URLs corrected (no duplicate paths, proper slashes)
- ✅ **Mapping File Fixed**: All 660 URLs in `cloudinary_mapping.json` normalized
- ✅ **Code Improved**: `upload_to_cloudinary.py` now handles URL normalization automatically
- ✅ **Temporary Scripts Removed**: Clean codebase without fix scripts
- ⏳ **Git Push Status**: Unknown (PowerShell output issue)
- ⏳ **Website Testing**: Pending (Hugo server not accessible)

**Codebase Changes**:
- Enhanced `upload_to_cloudinary.py`: Added `normalize_url()`, improved `public_id` logic, removed conflicting options
- Fixed 6 markdown files (634 URL corrections)
- Fixed `cloudinary_mapping.json` (660 URL corrections)
- Deleted 2 temporary fix scripts

**Known Issues**:
1. **PowerShell Output Issue**: Git commands execute but show no output, making it difficult to verify push status
2. **Hugo Server**: Local testing not completed due to connection issues
3. **Git Push Verification**: Need to manually verify if commits were pushed successfully

## Cumulative Decision Log (ADR - Architecture Decision Records)

### 2026-02-01: ADR-006 - URL Normalization in Upload Script

**Context**:
After initial migration, discovered all 634 Cloudinary URLs contained duplicated path segments (e.g., `/myblog/path/myblog/path/file.jpg`), causing 404 errors. Root cause: `upload_to_cloudinary.py` was setting both `folder` parameter and `public_id` with full path, causing Cloudinary to duplicate paths.

**Decision**:
Integrate URL normalization directly into `upload_to_cloudinary.py` instead of using separate fix scripts.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Separate Fix Scripts**: Created `fix_duplicate_paths.py` and `fix_missing_slashes.py` - quick fix but adds technical debt
2. **Fix in Upload Script**: Chosen - prevents issues at source, cleaner codebase
3. **Post-Processing Script**: More complex, requires running after every upload

**Consequences**:
- ✅ **Pros**:
  - Prevents URL issues at source
  - Automatic normalization for all future uploads
  - Cleaner codebase (no temporary fix scripts)
  - Self-healing: `save_mapping()` normalizes existing URLs
- ⚠️ **Trade-offs**:
  - Slight performance overhead (minimal, URL processing is fast)
  - More complex upload function (acceptable for correctness)

**Implementation**:
- Added `normalize_url()` function to handle:
  - Duplicate path segment removal
  - Missing slash fixes (e.g., `ch1IMG_xxx.jpg` → `ch1/IMG_xxx.jpg`)
- Removed `folder` parameter from upload options
- Removed `use_filename=True` to avoid conflicts
- Added normalization in `save_mapping()` to fix existing URLs

### 2026-01-31: ADR-001 - External CDN for Media Storage

**Context**: 
Repository contained 659 media files (646 images, 13 videos) totaling ~500MB+, causing:
- Git push operations taking 10+ minutes
- Repository size bloating to hundreds of MB
- Poor clone performance
- Git's inefficiency with binary files

**Decision**: 
Migrate all media files to Cloudinary CDN instead of Git LFS or keeping files in repository.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Git LFS**: Would keep files in git but requires LFS server, limited free tier (1GB)
2. **External CDN (Cloudinary)**: Chosen - 25GB free storage, automatic optimization, CDN delivery
3. **Separate Media Repository**: More complex, submodule management overhead
4. **Optimize Before Commit**: Quick win but doesn't solve root problem

**Consequences**:
- ✅ **Pros**: 
  - Fast CDN delivery (global edge locations)
  - Automatic image optimization (WebP, quality adjustment)
  - Reduced repository size by ~500MB
  - Better scalability (no git performance degradation)
  - Free tier sufficient for current needs (25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month)
- ⚠️ **Trade-offs**:
  - External dependency (Cloudinary service availability)
  - File size limit: 100MB on free tier (requires compression for larger videos)
  - Additional setup complexity (API keys, environment variables)
  - Migration effort required (one-time)

**CAP/PACELC Considerations**:
- **Consistency**: Eventual (CDN propagation delay ~1-2 seconds)
- **Availability**: High (Cloudinary SLA 99.9%)
- **Partition Tolerance**: Handled by CDN edge locations
- **Latency**: Optimized (CDN edge caching)
- **Consistency**: Acceptable trade-off for static media (read-heavy workload)

### 2026-01-31: ADR-002 - Mapping File Strategy for Incremental Updates

**Context**:
Need to prevent duplicate uploads when re-running upload script. Required mechanism to track which files have already been uploaded to Cloudinary.

**Decision**:
Use JSON mapping file (`cloudinary_mapping.json`) with local relative path as key, storing Cloudinary URL and metadata.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Database**: Overkill for simple key-value mapping
2. **Cloudinary API queries**: Slow, rate-limited, unnecessary API calls
3. **JSON file**: Chosen - Simple, version-controllable, fast local lookups

**Consequences**:
- ✅ **Pros**:
  - Fast lookups (O(1) dictionary access)
  - Version controllable (can track changes in git)
  - Human-readable format
  - Enables incremental updates (only upload new files)
- ⚠️ **Trade-offs**:
  - File grows with each upload (currently 659 entries, ~150KB)
  - Manual cleanup may be needed if file becomes too large
  - Requires file I/O operations (negligible performance impact)

### 2026-01-31: ADR-003 - Deduplication Before Upload

**Context**:
Initial uploads created duplicate entries in Cloudinary due to path construction issues. Need to identify and remove duplicates to prevent storage waste.

**Decision**:
Implement pre-upload duplicate detection script that queries Cloudinary API, identifies duplicates by filename, and removes redundant copies (keeping oldest).

**Consequences**:
- ✅ **Pros**:
  - Prevents storage waste
  - Cleaner Cloudinary dashboard
  - Reduces confusion
  - One-time cleanup operation
- ⚠️ **Trade-offs**:
  - Additional API calls (minimal impact)
  - Requires manual execution or integration into workflow

### 2026-01-31: ADR-004 - Large Video Handling Strategy

**Context**:
Videos >50MB failed to upload with error "Video is too large to process synchronously". Cloudinary free tier has 100MB file size limit.

**Decision**:
- Files 20-50MB: Use `upload_large()` method for reliability
- Files >50MB: Upload without format conversion to avoid sync processing
- Files >100MB: Require compression before upload (FFmpeg)

**Consequences**:
- ✅ **Pros**:
  - Handles edge cases gracefully
  - Avoids processing errors
  - Maintains file quality for smaller videos
- ⚠️ **Trade-offs**:
  - Files >100MB require external tool (FFmpeg)
  - Compression adds processing time
  - May require admin privileges for FFmpeg installation

### 2026-01-31: ADR-005 - Set-Based File Discovery for Windows Compatibility

**Context**:
Upload script was processing each file twice, causing duplicate upload warnings. Root cause: Windows file system case-insensitivity combined with searching both `.jpg` and `.JPG` extensions.

**Decision**:
Change `find_media_files()` to use Python `set()` instead of `list()` for automatic deduplication, ensuring each file path is processed exactly once.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ **Pros**:
  - Eliminates duplicate processing
  - Works correctly on Windows (case-insensitive) and Linux (case-sensitive)
  - Minimal code change (1 line)
- ⚠️ **Trade-offs**:
  - Slight memory overhead (negligible for 659 files)
  - Requires sorting before return (O(n log n) vs O(n))
